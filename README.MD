# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
## 1. Welcome and Project Introduction
Objective: Predict future stock prices using historical data.
Importance: This helps investors and analysts make informed decisions, optimize portfolios, and reduce risks while maximizing profits.

## 2. Dataset Overview
The dataset will include historical stock data:
Open
Close
High
Low
Volume

## 3. Tools and Libraries
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
These will be used to perform data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.

## 4. Key Steps in the Project
### Model Training & Testing:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train multiple regression models (SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Bayesian, KNN).
Tune models using GridSearchCV.

### Evaluation & Visualization:
Evaluate models on test data using performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score.
Visualize actual vs. predicted prices.

## 5. Success Criteria
Achieve low error values and model stability across different time windows.
Clear and informative visualizations showing the alignment of actual vs. predicted prices.

## 6. Deliverables
Code: Well-documented Python notebooks containing the necessary functions and steps.
Report:
Dataset description and model comparison.
Visualizations of predictions versus actual stock prices.
Analysis of the best-performing model.
